  "what_makes_bold": "Have you seen the size of heart-shaped strawberries, those raspberries full of juice or blueberries that measure the same size as a ten peso coin? As surprising and unusual as their flavor. How do they do it? ?",
  "what_makes_description": "The answer is very simple, Driscoll's maintains its cultivation and development procedures naturally, without irradiation or genetic modifications, just as it was done hundreds of years ago. Our berries represent the effort and experience of a family business who began growing strawberries in Pájaro Valley California more than a hundred years ago and decided to maintain their cultivation processes, always working hand in hand with nature. Currently Driscoll's is a family business with a presence on five continents, we are globally distinguished for produce only the best berries."
